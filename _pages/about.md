#### **About Me**
Hello! Iâ€™m Junseo Lee, also known as Harris.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, with full support from the Hyundai Motor Foundation. I am currently fulfilling my national duty as a theoretical quantum computing research scientist, serving as an alternative to military service. I conduct research in the Quantum Information Theory Group (Team QST) at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University, under the guidance of [Kabgyun Jeong](https://sites.google.com/site/kabgyunspage/), since my undergraduate studies.

For more details, you can find my CV [here](/cv).

#### **Research Interests**
My primary research interest lies in the theory of quantum computation and quantum information, but I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science from a wider perspective.

More specifically, my research focuses on:
- Quantum learning theory
- Quantum property testing
- Quantum complexity theory
- Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes

In the past, I have worked on (though not currently active) the following topics, which I still find interesting:
- Quantum channel capacity and quantum entropy power inequality
- Quantum continuous variable systems (bosonic gaussian systems)
- (Variational) Quantum machine learning and its applications

#### **Service**
I serve as a reviewer for *IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*.

In 2024, I was a selection committee member for the *Quantum Internship Program* organized by the Korea Quantum Industry Center and the National Information Society Agency.
