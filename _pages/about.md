#### About Me
Hello! I’m Junseo Lee, also known as Harris.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do), fully supported by the [Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Scholarship](https://www.hyundai-cmkfoundation.org/en/main). I am currently fulfilling my mandatory national service through an alternative program, working as a research scientist in theoretical quantum computing. 

Since my undergraduate years, I have been part of the Quantum Information Theory Group at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University, initially as a research assistant and now as a research associate, continuing my work with the group. For more details, you can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_harris_junseo.pdf).

<b>Contact:</b> I love discussing new research ideas and beyond, so feel free to reach out to me at <span style="color:#0F52BA;">`harris.junseo(at)gmail.com`</span> for collaborations, questions, or just to connect. I’m always happy to hear from you!

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko).

#### Research Interests
My main research interest lies in the theory of quantum computation, with a particular curiosity about how physical and computational resources and constraints shape the behavior of quantum systems. More broadly, I am also interested in theoretical computer science and quantum information.

Recently, my primary research focuses on the following topics:

<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
  <details>
    <summary><b>Quantum Learning Theory</b></summary>
    <p>
      I study efficient algorithms and lower bounds for learning and testing tasks 
      on both discrete and continuous-variable quantum systems, including quantum states, 
      unitaries, and channels. A central question I pursue is 
      <i>"how different resources affect the feasibility and complexity of extracting 
      information from quantum systems."</i>
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><b>Quantum Complexity Theory</b></summary>
    <p>
      I investigate the capabilities and limitations of quantum proof systems and 
      complexity classes, with particular attention to 
      <i>"how restrictions such as quantum advice, entanglement, or uniqueness conditions 
      change the computational power of quantum models."</i> 
      This includes studying quantum-classical separations and structural properties 
      of quantum complexity classes.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><b>Quantum Algorithms</b></summary>
    <p>
      For me, learning theory represents the <i>“final step”</i> of quantum information 
      processing, while complexity theory provides the fundamental landscape of what 
      quantum computers can or cannot do. Building on these theoretical foundations, 
      I aim to design efficient quantum algorithms and protocols that leverage quantum 
      advantages in solving concrete problems, particularly in algebra, combinatorics, 
      and topology.
    </p>
  </details>

I have also worked on other topics in the past, including quantum channel capacity and the quantum entropy power inequality, and quantum machine learning and its applications.
