Hello! I’m Junseo Lee (also known as Harris).

I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do), fully supported by the [Hyundai Motor CMK Foundation](https://www.hyundai-cmkfoundation.org/en/main). After completing my undergraduate studies, I fulfilled my mandatory military service in South Korea as a Technical Research Personnel, during which I spent three years conducting research in theoretical quantum computing. Since my undergraduate years, I have been affiliated with the Quantum Information Theory Group at the [Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University](https://rim.math.snu.ac.kr/).

For more details, please see my **[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf)**. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko), and on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/harris_junseo).

<b>I also maintain the <a href="/quantum-learning-theory-references/">Quantum Learning Theory Zoo</a></b>, a curated reference page collecting key works in quantum learning theory. If you’re interested in this rapidly growing field, feel free to explore and share it!

#### Research Interests
Recently, my primary research focuses on the following topics:
- Quantum tomography, learning, and many-body theory
- Quantum complexity theory
- Quantum algorithms
- Quantum Shannon theory
- Continuous-variable quantum information

I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science, mathematical physics, and computational topology. For a detailed overview of my research directions, please refer to my <a href="/publications/" target="_blank">publications</a>.
