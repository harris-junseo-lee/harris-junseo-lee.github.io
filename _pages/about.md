#### **About Me**
Hello! I’m Junseo Lee, also known as Harris.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, fully supported by the Hyundai Motor Foundation. I am currently fulfilling my mandatory national service through an alternative program, working as a research scientist in theoretical quantum computing. In addition, I have been continuously conducting research since my undergraduate years with the Quantum Information Theory Group at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University. For more details, you can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_harris_junseo.pdf).

**Contact:** I love discussing new research ideas and beyond, so feel free to reach out to me at `harris.junseo(at)gmail.com` for collaborations, questions, or just to connect. I’m always happy to hear from you!

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko).

#### **Research Interests**
My main research interest lies in the theory of quantum computation. More broadly, I am also interested in theoretical computer science and quantum information.

Recently, my primary research focuses on the following topics:

- **Quantum Learning Theory**: Analysis of efficient algorithms and derivation of lower bounds for learning or testing tasks on quantum systems, including quantum states, unitaries, and channels.
- **Quantum Complexity Theory**: Study of the capabilities and limitations of quantum computers, quantum proof systems, and separations between classical and quantum complexity classes.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Design of efficient quantum algorithms for algebraic, combinatorial, and computational geometry problems, including applications in topological data analysis.

I have also worked on other topics in the past, including quantum channel capacity and the quantum entropy power inequality, quantum continuous variable systems (bosonic Gaussian systems), and quantum machine learning and its applications.
