Hello! My name is Junseo Lee (also known as Harris).

I am currently fulfilling my military alternative service as a Quantum Computing Researcher at Norma Inc. Additionally, I am working as a Research Assistant with [Quantum Information Theory Group at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University](https://sites.google.com/view/team-qst/home).

My main research areas are quantum information and quantum computation, with a primary focus on theoretical works. I enjoy exploring quantum Shannon theory, quantum learning theory, quantum complexity theory, and more recently, quantum error correction codes. For more information about my research, please refer to the list of my [publications](/publications) and [presentations](/presentations).

I am preparing to pursue a Ph.D. starting in Fall 2026, coinciding with the end of my military service.

For research collaborations or any other inquiries, please feel free to contact me at `harris.junseo@gmail.com`.
You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko).
