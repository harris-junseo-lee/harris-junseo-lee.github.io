#### **About Me**
Hello! I’m Junseo Lee, also known as Harris.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, fully supported by the Hyundai Motor Foundation. I am currently fulfilling my mandatory national service through an alternative program, working as a research scientist in theoretical quantum computing. In addition, I have been continuously conducting research since my undergraduate years with the Quantum Information Theory Group at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University. For more details, you can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_harris_junseo.pdf).

**Contact:** I love discussing new research ideas and beyond, so feel free to reach out to me at `harris.junseo(at)gmail.com` for collaborations, questions, or just to connect. I’m always happy to hear from you!

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko).

#### **Research Interests**
My main research interest lies in the theory of quantum computation, and more broadly, I am also interested in theoretical computer science and quantum information.

Recently, my primary research focus has been on the following topics:
- **Quantum learning theory** (sample, computational, and time complexity of learning quantum states, unitaries, channels, and processes under various constraints)
- **Quantum property estimation and testing** (algorithms and complexity for estimating properties of quantum systems, including quantum entropy and distance measures)
- **Quantum complexity theory** (connections between QMA complexity and quantum many-body physics; query complexity of quantum algorithms; random unitaries and related structures)

In the past, I have also worked on the following topics. While I am not actively pursuing them at the moment, I continue to find them fascinating:
- Quantum channel capacity and the quantum entropy power inequality
- Quantum continuous variable systems (bosonic Gaussian systems)
- Quantum machine learning and its applications

#### **Service**
I have served as a peer reviewer for *Physical Review Letters, Physical Review A, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*, and *Annalen der Physik*.

In 2024 and 2025, I was a member of the selection committee for the Quantum Internship Program, organized by the Korea Quantum Industry Center and the National Information Society Agency.
