Hello! I’m Junseo Lee, also known as Harris.  

I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University and am currently serving my national duty as a *theoretical quantum computing research scientist*, fulfilling an alternative to military service.
I conduct research in the Quantum Information Theory Group (Team QST) at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University.

My research focuses on the **theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation.** Lately, I’ve been particularly interested in:  
- Quantum learning theory, leveraging information-theoretic tools such as concentration inequalities  
- Computational complexity, quantum algorithms, and provable quantum advantages  
- Quantum Shannon theory, including bounds on quantum channel capacity and quantum entropy inequalities  
- Quantum error correction, especially quantum LDPC codes and their applications in theoretical computer science

For research collaborations or any other inquiries, feel free to contact me at `harris.junseo(at)gmail.com`.
