#### **About Me**
Hello! I’m Junseo Lee, also known as Harris.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, fully supported by the Hyundai Motor Foundation. I’m currently fulfilling my national duty by working as a theoretical quantum computing research scientist, serving as an alternative to military service. I’ve been conducting research in the Quantum Information Theory Group (Team QST) at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University, under the guidance of [Kabgyun Jeong](https://sites.google.com/site/kabgyunspage/), since my undergraduate years.

For more details, you can check out my CV [here](/cv).

#### **Research Interests**
My main research interest lies in the theory of quantum computation and quantum information, but I also have a broad interest in theoretical computer science more generally.

More specifically, I focus on:
- Quantum learning theory
- Quantum property testing
- Quantum complexity theory
- Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes

I’ve also worked on the following topics in the past — I’m not actively involved in them at the moment, but I still find them fascinating:
- Quantum channel capacity and quantum entropy power inequality
- Quantum continuous variable systems (bosonic Gaussian systems)
- (Variational) quantum machine learning and its applications

#### **Service**
I serve as a reviewer for *IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*.

In 2024, I was part of the selection committee for the *Quantum Internship Program* organized by the Korea Quantum Industry Center and the National Information Society Agency.
