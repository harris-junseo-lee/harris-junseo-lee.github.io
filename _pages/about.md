Hello! My name is Junseo Lee (also known as Harris).

I am currently fulfilling my military alternative service as a Theoretical Quantum Computing Research Scientist at Norma Inc.

My main research areas include the theory of quantum information and quantum computation. I enjoy exploring quantum Shannon theory, quantum learning theory, quantum complexity theory, and, more recently, fault-tolerant quantum computation. For more information about my research, please refer to the list of my [publications](/publications) and [talks](/talks).

For research collaborations or any other inquiries, feel free to contact me at `harris.junseo@gmail.com`.
You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko).

Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Harris_Junseo_Lee.pdf).
