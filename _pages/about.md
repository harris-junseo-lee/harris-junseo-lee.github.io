#### About Me
Hello! I’m Junseo Lee (also known as Harris).

I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do), fully supported by the [Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo Foundation](https://www.hyundai-cmkfoundation.org/en/main). I am currently fulfilling my mandatory national service through an alternative program, working as a research scientist in theoretical quantum computing.

Since my undergraduate years, I have been a member of the Quantum Information Theory Group at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University, where I first worked as a research assistant and now continue as a research associate. For more details, you can find my [<b>Curriculum Vitae (CV)</b>](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

<b>Contact:</b> For collaborations or research discussions, feel free to reach out at:<br>
📧 <code>harris (dot) [first name, all lowercase] (at) gmail.com</code>

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko), and on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/harris_junseo).

<b>I also maintain the <a href="/quantum-learning-theory-references/">Quantum Learning Theory Zoo</a></b>, a curated reference page collecting key works in quantum learning theory. If you’re interested in this rapidly growing field, feel free to explore and share it!

#### Research Interests
Recently, my primary research focuses on the following topics:
- Quantum tomography, learning, and many-body theory
- Quantum complexity theory
- Quantum algorithms
- Quantum Shannon theory
- Quantum information processing with bosons

I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science, mathematical physics, and computational topology. For a detailed overview of my research directions, please refer to my <a href="/publications/" target="_blank">publications</a>.

    <summary><b>Quantum Learning Theory</b></summary>
    <p>
      My research in quantum learning theory focuses on developing efficient algorithms and 
      fundamental lower bounds for learning and testing tasks over both discrete-variable (DV) 
      and continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems — including quantum states, unitary transformations, 
      and dynamical processes. I aim to characterize the precise sample and query complexities 
      required for learning under physically meaningful constraints, such as limited energy or 
      single-copy access. Broadly, my work seeks to understand 
      <i>how different physical and informational resources fundamentally shape the feasibility 
      and efficiency of extracting information from quantum systems.</i>
    </p>

    <summary><b>Quantum Complexity Theory</b></summary>
    <p>
      I study the computational power and structural properties of quantum proof systems and 
      complexity classes. My work explores 
      <i>how constraints such as bounded entanglement, quantum advice, or uniqueness conditions 
      affect the expressive and computational capabilities of quantum models.</i> 
      I am particularly interested in the theory of quantum interactive proof systems and 
      their connections to quantum cryptography and verification. 
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><b>Quantum Algorithms</b></summary>
    <p>
      Building on insights from quantum learning and complexity theory, I design 
      <i>end-to-end quantum algorithms</i> that bridge theoretical feasibility with 
      experimental realizability. My current focus lies in constructing 
      resource-efficient protocols that harness quantum advantages for concrete problems in 
      algebraic, combinatorial, and topological domains. 
      Ultimately, I aim to develop algorithmic frameworks that connect the 
      <i>mathematical foundations of quantum information</i> to the 
      <i>practical goal of making quantum computers learn and reason efficiently 
      from data and physical systems.</i>
