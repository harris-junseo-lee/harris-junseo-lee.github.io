Hello! My name is Junseo Lee (also known as Harris).

I am currently fulfilling my national service as a **Theoretical Quantum Computing Research Scientist**, as an alternative to military conscription.

My current research areas include:
- Quantum learning theory using information-theoretic tools (including concentration inequalities)
- Computational complexity, quantum algorithms, and provable quantum computational advantages
- Quantum error-correcting codes, primarily quantum LDPC codes, and their applications in theoretical computer science
- Quantum Shannon theory, including determining bounds on quantum channel capacity and quantum entropy inequalities

For research collaborations or any other inquiries, feel free to contact me at `harris.junseo@gmail.com`.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/harris-quantum) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=mal5ZI8AAAAJ&hl=ko).
