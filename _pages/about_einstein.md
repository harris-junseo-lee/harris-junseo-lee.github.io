Hello! My name is Junseo Lee (also known as Harris).

I am currently fulfilling my military alternative service as a Quantum Computing Researcher at Norma Inc. Additionally, I am working as a Research Assistant with Team QST (Quantum Group) at the Research Institute of Mathematics, Seoul National University. My main research areas are quantum information and quantum computation, primarily focusing on theoretical works.

I am preparing to pursue a Ph.D. starting in Fall 2026, coinciding with the end of my military service.

For research collaborations or any other inquiries, please feel free to contact me at the email address provided above!
